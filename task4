Here's a basic speech recognition system for command-based control of devices using an embedded board:

System Components
1. Embedded Board: Raspberry Pi or Arduino Board
2. Microphone: USB Microphone or Analog Microphone
3. Speaker: USB Speaker or Analog Speaker
4. Devices: LED lights, fans, or other appliances to be controlled

System Design
1. Speech Recognition: Use a speech recognition library such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Services, or Mozilla DeepSpeech.
2. Command Processing: Process the recognized speech commands and convert them into device control signals.
3. Device Control: Use the device control signals to control the devices.

Code
Raspberry Pi (Python)

import speech_recognition as sr
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Set up speech recognition
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Set up GPIO pins
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)  # LED light

while True:
    # Listen for speech input
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = r.listen(source)

    # Recognize speech
    try:
        command = r.recognize_google(audio, language="en-US")
        print("You said: " + command)

        # Process command and control device
        if command == "turn on light":
            GPIO.output(17, GPIO.HIGH)
        elif command == "turn off light":
            GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Speech recognition could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}".format(e))


Arduino Board (C++)

c++
#include <SpeechRecognition.h>
#include <Arduino.h>

// Set up speech recognition
SpeechRecognition sr;

// Set up device control pins
const int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  // Initialize speech recognition
  sr.begin();

  // Initialize device control pins
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Listen for speech input
  if (sr.available()) {
    String command = sr.readStringUntil('\n');

    // Process command and control device
    if (command == "turn on light") {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    } else if (command == "turn off light") {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    }
  }
}


Working Demo
1. Connect the microphone and speaker to the embedded board.
2. Connect the devices to be controlled to the embedded board.
3. Upload the code to the embedded board.
4. Test the speech recognition system by speaking commands to control the devices.

Note
- Make sure to install the necessary speech recognition library and dependencies.
- Adjust the speech recognition settings and device control pins according to your specific setup.
- This is a basic example and may require additional modifications for a more robust speech recognition system.
